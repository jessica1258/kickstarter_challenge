# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview
### The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationship between campaign launch timing and funding outcomes for theater kickstarter campaigns. In addition, we look closer at theater kickstarter campaigns specifically for plays to understand the relationship between the size of the funding goal and the outcome of the campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### In order to understand the relationship between campaign launch timing and funding outcomes, we analyzed data for the theater category. This analysis was completed using data on 1,369 completed or cancelled theater kickstarter campaigns that launched between July 2010 and February 2017. Analysis was limited to consider the month of the launch without consideration to the year and included all subcategories within the theater category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
